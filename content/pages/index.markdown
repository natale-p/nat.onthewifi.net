I am working in an 8-bit color terminal, listening in a 128-bit quality,
experiencing a lossless world. I got my Ph.D. in I.C.T. from UNIMORE (Italy) in
2017. Played in a rock-band, surfed the most beautiful seas, swum the most
competitive competitions.


Natale Patriciello received his M.S. with honors from the University of Bologna
(Italy) in 2013, and his Ph.D. in ICT from UNIMORE (Italy) in 2017. He has been
involved in the EU FP7 Projects PPDR-TC. His research interests are in the area
of computer networking and theoretical computer science. He was active in the
development of ns-3 (a network simulator) and closely follows the Linux kernel
networking stack evolution, with an emphasis on the TCP module. Currently is a
Senior Software Engineer at Vonage, in the Video Cloud Team, focusing on
different networking aspects of WebRTC communications.
