I am working in an 8-bit color terminal, listening in a 128-bit quality,
experiencing a lossless world. I got my Ph.D. in I.C.T. from UNIMORE (Italy) in
2017. Played in a rock-band, surfed the most beautiful seas, swum the most
competitive competitions.

Natale Patriciello received his M.S. with honors from the University of Bologna
(Italy) in 2013, and his Ph.D. in ICT from UNIMORE (Italy) in 2017. He has been
involved in the EU FP7 Projects PPDR-TC. His research interests were in the area
of computer networking and theoretical computer science. He was active in the
development of ns-3 (a network simulator) and closely follows the Linux kernel
networking stack evolution, with an emphasis on the TCP module. He served as a
Researcher scientist at CTTC in Barcelona (Spain), where he was involved in
various 5G NR and NR-U industrial projects. He is currently a Senior Software
Engineer at Vonage, working on a webRTC stack for real-time communications.
