Summary: Delving into the nuances between permissive and copyleft licenses, this article unpacks the misconception that copyleft licenses are more restrictive than permissive ones, asserting that copyleft, while imposing obligations, actually enhances freedom by guaranteeing rights to users.

In this article, the author addresses the common misconception that copyleft
licenses are more restrictive than permissive ones by exploring the deeper
understanding of freedom embedded within copyleft licensing. Both permissive
and copyleft licenses impose obligations, but these obligations are not
synonymous with restrictions. While permissive licenses grant broad usage
rights with few obligations, copyleft licenses ensure freedom by obliging
reciprocity, thereby constraining the power dynamics inherent in proprietary
software. By grounding the discussion in political terms and drawing parallels
with legal frameworks like the US constitution, the article emphasizes the role
of obligations in fostering freedom and protecting the rights of users.
