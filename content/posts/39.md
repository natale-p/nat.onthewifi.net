Summary: Exploring how Goodhart's Law impacts software engineering metrics and practices.

- **Definition of Goodhart's Law:** When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
- **Weak Interpretation:** Metrics can be manipulated, leading to practices like closing bugs without proper resolution to reduce bug counts.
- **Strong Interpretation:** Even with honest intentions, overemphasis on specific metrics can detract from actual goals due to the inherent difference between metrics and true objectives.
- **Example in Software Reliability:** Using the number of open bugs as a proxy for software reliability can be misleading, as it doesn't account for unreported issues or the quality of fixes.
- **Biological Analogy:** Peacock tail evolution demonstrates Goodhart's Law; extravagant tails, initially a fitness indicator, can become detrimental when overemphasized.
- **Engineering Metrics Affected:**
  - *Test Coverage:* May not reflect the depth or effectiveness of tests.
  - *Cyclomatic Complexity and Function Size:* Focusing solely on these can overlook overall code readability and maintainability.
  - *Benchmarks:* Optimizing for specific benchmarks might degrade performance in unmeasured areas.
- **Challenges in Mitigation:** Balancing multiple metrics to avoid overoptimization is complex and may lead to conflicting priorities.
