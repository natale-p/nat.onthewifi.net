Summary: An exploration of the soft skills that differentiate Staff Engineers from Senior Engineers, starting with communication.

## Introduction

After observing hundreds of staff+ engineers, I've realized that the mastery of soft skills is the most significant difference between a Senior and a Staff Engineer. While technical proficiency is essential, soft skills enable engineers to interact better with others, bridging the gap between technical and business contexts. These skills are not just job-specific but are transferable to other parts of life.

## Mastering Communication

The first soft skill to master is communication, which includes writing, speaking, and nonverbal communication. Staff Engineers are super communicators who excel at bridging the gap between technical and business contexts. Below are my tips on mastering each mode of communication.

### Writing

**Why write?**

Writing is crucial, even if you think, "I already code all day—I don't need to learn how to write." Staff Engineers frequently write technical documents, slides, and project updates. Here are my tips:

- **Consider your audience:** Know who you're writing for and tailor your message accordingly.
- **Read and re-read:** Spend three times as much time reading as you do writing. Every word counts.
- **Be succinct:** Make your point clear and use a TLDR to help others grasp the content quickly.
- **Write regularly:** Developing your writing style takes practice. Write often, even if you don't share it.
- **Read, learn, and copy:** Study how others write. Save examples you like for future reference.

**Example: Writing a Technical Spec**

1. **Do your research:** Look for examples that communicate clearly and decide on your style before writing.
2. **Put it together:** Define technical terms, set common ground, and structure content clearly.
3. **Finalize and share:** Reach out to key stakeholders for feedback and share a polished version.

### Speaking

**Why learn how to speak?**

Speaking is an often overlooked skill, but it's crucial for leading meetings, participating in stand-ups, or presenting to large audiences. 

- **Be concise:** Write down what you want to say beforehand. Start with your TLDR and then expand.
- **Speak clearly and confidently:** Enunciate your words and maintain a steady pace.
- **Watch your audience:** Adjust your delivery based on their reactions.

**Example: Presenting a Slide Deck**

1. **Set up your slides:** Use images and keep text minimal. Use speaker notes for guidance.
2. **Copy great examples:** Watch TED talks and practice in front of a mirror.
3. **End with impact:** Summarize key points and provide a call to action on your last slide.

### Nonverbal Communication

**What is nonverbal communication?**

Nonverbal communication includes facial expressions, gestures, body language, and tone of voice. It’s the most overlooked form of communication but can significantly enhance your interactions.

- **Observe body language:** Watch how others respond to adjust your content and delivery.
- **Watch your/their tone:** Tone conveys a lot of information; adapt based on the other person’s tone.
- **Smile:** A simple smile at the start and end of a meeting can create a positive atmosphere.

## Conclusion

Mastering communication is essential for any Staff+ Engineer. Start by honing your writing, speaking, and nonverbal communication skills to elevate your career. Stay tuned for the next part of this series, where I’ll discuss adaptability.
