Summary: An exploration of how our perception of time accelerates with age and the neurobiological factors influencing it.

- **Perception of Time:** Time seems to pass more quickly as we age, with experiences becoming less novel and dopamine levels decreasing.
- **Neurobiology and Time:** Dopamine, which impacts our internal clock, plays a significant role in how we perceive time. Higher dopamine levels from novel experiences slow down our perception of time.
- **Reminiscence Bump:** Novel experiences, especially during formative years, create lasting memories and impact how we perceive our identity and time.
- **Cognitive Illusion:** The perceived acceleration of time as we age is a cognitive illusion, driven by the repetition of daily routines and a decrease in novel stimuli.
- **Perceived Age Concept:** As we age, each year represents a smaller percentage of our life, making time feel shorter. This concept highlights the discrepancy between chronological and perceived age.
- **Embracing Novelty:** Engaging in new activities and experiences can help stretch our subjective sense of time, counteracting the perceived acceleration that comes with age.
- **Life Perspective:** The blog reflects on how embracing change and maintaining dynamic habits can make life feel more fulfilling, even as time seems to speed up.
