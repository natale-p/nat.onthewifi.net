Summary: The blog argues that software engineers should focus on automation rather than predictable, routine tasks, to avoid becoming mere technicians.

- **Predictability vs. Innovation:** The author challenges the notion that predictability in software engineering is beneficial, arguing that it often leads to anti-automation and stagnation.
- **Automation Over Routine:** A great software engineer should automate repetitive tasks instead of becoming comfortable with them, as predictable work often signals a missed opportunity for automation.
- **Technician vs. Engineer:** The blog distinguishes between technicians, who perform routine and predictable tasks, and engineers, who push boundaries and focus on automation.
- **Business Impact:** The post highlights the importance of encouraging automation within tech companies to drive greater value and avoid over-hiring for routine tasks.
