Summary: A seasoned systems administrator shares his firsthand exploration of Kubernetes, dispelling skepticism with practical insights into its core components and operations.

- **Initial Skepticism:** The author begins with a skeptical view of Kubernetes, mainly due to its perceived complexity and the shift it represents from traditional infrastructure management.
- **Control Loops:** Kubernetes' control loops are highlighted as a key value proposition, automatically managing workloads to achieve desired states by continuously adjusting based on sensor observations.
- **Service Management:** The blog emphasizes the robust service management capabilities of Kubernetes, including stable identity, load balancing, and service discovery, which eliminate single points of failure.
- **Workload Management:** The post discusses the difference between manually creating Pods and using ReplicaSets or Deployments, which ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and streamlined updates.
- **Storage Management:** Insights are provided into Kubernetes' storage solutions, such as Ephemeral and Persistent Volumes, and how they enable data persistence and sharing between Pods.
- **Open Questions:** The author leaves with several open-ended questions and rants, particularly around the design choices in Kubernetes, like its reliance on text interpolation and the out-of-tree nature of networking and storage implementations.
