Jakob Greenfeld advocates for the principle of following one's curiosity as a
guide to achieving great work. He contrasts this with the pitfalls of chasing
prestige, money, or ambitious goals that often lead to dissatisfaction. The
article includes insights from David Perell and Shaan Puri, who both
experienced creative slumps when they deviated from their natural curiosity.
Greenfeld argues that a bottom-up approach, where one allows curiosity to guide
decisions, leads to more fulfilling and successful outcomes, as opposed to
rigidly planning and overthinking decisions.
