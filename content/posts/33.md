Summary: A vision for a simpler, more accessible Internet powered by Tailscale, addressing the pitfalls of current cloud-centralized systems.

- **The Vision:** Tailscale is working towards creating a "New Internet," focusing on reducing unnecessary complexity in software development by leveraging direct peer-to-peer connectivity.
- **The Problem with Scaling:** Many developers over-prioritize scalability, leading to complex, inefficient systems. Most tasks don't require such scalability, yet industry practices push us toward it.
- **Centralization Issues:** The modern Internet is overly centralized, with major cloud providers like AWS monopolizing resources and charging rent for access, much like IBM did in the past.
- **Tailscale's Solution:** By providing every device with its own identity, IP address, and end-to-end encryption, Tailscale simplifies networking, bypassing traditional firewalls and allowing direct peer connections.
- **Taildrop Example:** Taildrop, a file transfer feature, exemplifies the New Internet by enabling direct file sharing without relying on cloud services, thus eliminating unnecessary costs and complexity.
- **Future Implications:** As Tailscale grows, it could disrupt current Internet structures, democratizing access to connectivity and enabling the creation of applications previously unimaginable in a centralized Internet.
