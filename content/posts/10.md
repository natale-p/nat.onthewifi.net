A recent study has found that Agile software projects experience a 268% higher
failure rate compared to traditional projects. The study underscores the
importance of clear requirements and effective requirements engineering. Poor
understanding of Agile principles and inadequate training are cited as key
factors contributing to these high failure rates. The findings suggest that
organizations need to invest more in training and properly implementing Agile
methodologies to avoid common pitfalls and enhance project success.
