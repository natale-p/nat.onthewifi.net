Summary: Eight essential practices for designing reliable software, based on lessons learned through experience.

- **Use Off-The-Shelf:** Prioritize existing solutions like Redis unless the component is expensive or critical to your software's value.
- **Cost And Reliability Over Features:** Focus on creating a reliable and cost-effective solution with minimal features, as it's easier to add features to a reliable system than to make a feature-rich system reliable.
- **Idea To Production Quickly:** Deploy a minimal feature set to production to quickly identify necessary features and refine the solution based on real-world use.
- **Simple Data Structures:** Opt for simple data structures to avoid performance issues and bugs that can arise from complexity.
- **Reserve Resources Early:** Allocate necessary resources upfront to ensure the software can handle required loads and fail early if resources are inadequate.
- **Set Maximums:** Establish limits to avoid extreme cases that could degrade performance unpredictably, ensuring the software behaves consistently.
- **Make Testing Easy:** Implement easy testing methods, such as command-line inputs and assertions, to streamline the testing process and improve software reliability.
- **Embed Performance Counters:** Include performance counters to track how resources are used over time, helping to diagnose and optimize system performance.
