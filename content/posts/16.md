Summary: Exploring the inevitability of software complexity in engineering.

The post is available [here](https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2024/05/08/2024-ThreeLaws.html).

- **First Law:** Well-designed systems degrade over time, becoming difficult to change.
- **Second Law:** Complexity acts as a moat, reinforced by leaky abstractions.
- **Third Law:** Software complexity has no upper limit, driven by human creativity and organizational dynamics.
- Engineers often work on complex systems due to these inherent laws.
